The Nagari or Devanagari alphabet developed from eastern variants of the Gupta script called Nagari, which first emerged during the 8th century. This script was starting to resemble the modern Devanagari alphabet by the 10th century, and started to replace Siddham from about 1200.

The name Devanagari is made up of two Sanskrit words: deva, which means god, brahman or celestial, and nagari, which means city. The name is variously translated as "script of the city", "heavenly/sacred script of the city" or " [script of the] city of the Gods or priests".
